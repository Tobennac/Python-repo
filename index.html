									<h2><a href="https://github.com/Tobennac/SQL-repository/blob/main/Data%20cleaning%20script.sql">Data Cleaning in SQL<br />
									</a></h2>
									<p>In this project, i applied various data cleaning techniques to the Nashville Housing dataset. there were some issues such as duplicate rows, null values, inconsistent values and outliers. i used SQL commands to identify and correct these issues, and to ensure data quality and accuracy. i also checked the data for anomalies or patterns that could affect the analysis. by the end of this project, i had a clean and reliable datasett that was ready for futher exploration and visualization.</p>

									<p>In this project, I used SQL to explore a dataset containing information about student performance in three subjects: Mathematics and Reading and writing. The dataset had various features such as student grades, Parental level of education, Race/ethnicity and other related factors. I performed various queries to answer questions such as: How do the grades differ between the subjects? Which factors are most correlated with the final grade? How do the students' personal and family characteristics affect their performance? I also used SQL functions and commands to calculate summary statistics, group and aggregate data, and filter and sort results. I learned how to use SQL as a powerful tool for data analysis and gained valuable insights into the factors that influence student achievement.</p>

									<p>In this statement, I used the SQL load data infile command to import data from a CSV file named into a MySQL database. The CSV file had eighteen columns and over 50,000 rows. This statement is more efficient than the import Wizard, took 7 seconds as opposed to the hours it would have taken importing through the Wizard.</p>

										<h2><a href="https://github.com/Tobennac/Python-repo/blob/main/Twitter%20Scraper%20V8.ipynb.txt">Twitter Scraping with Python<br />
										</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/program-code-python-and-flask-framework-1.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>In this project, I used Python to scrape tweets from Donald Trump's Twitter account and perform some natural language processing tasks on them. I imported some libraries and modules, such as nltk, spacy, pandas, and numpy, to help me with the data processing and analysis. I also downloaded some nltk data packages, such as punkt and wordnet, which are used for tokenization and lemmatization. Tokenization is the process of splitting a text into smaller units, such as words and sentences. Lemmatization is the process of reducing a word to its base form, such as changing 'running' to 'run'. These steps are useful for normalizing and simplifying the text data.
										To scrape the tweets, I used a custom function called `scrape_tweets`, which takes a Twitter account name as an input and returns a pandas DataFrame with the tweet text, date, and other metadata. The function uses proxies to avoid being blocked by Twitter and prints some information messages to the standard error stream. The function also handles pagination and stops when it reaches the end of the tweet history or the specified limit. I scraped tweets from Donald Trump's account, which is @realDonaldTrump, and stored the result in a variable called `df`.
										The DataFrame `df` contains 200 tweets from Donald Trump, along with some information such as the tweet ID, the number of likes, retweets, and replies, and the source device. I used the `head` method to view the first five rows of the DataFrame and the `shape` attribute to check the number of rows and columns. The DataFrame has 200 rows and 10 columns. I also used the `info` method to get a summary of the DataFrame, such as the data types, the number of non-null values, and the memory usage.
